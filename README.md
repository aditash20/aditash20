# About Me:
Hi, I'm Aditya Sharma. <br>
I'm passionate about computer vision, applied AI, and building models that bridge research with real-world applications.<br>

My journey started with deep learning for automotive image analysis, where I trained models like MVANet and BiRefNet, built OpenCV pipelines for large-scale image processing, and deployed everything on NVIDIA Triton to handle 10K+ images per day. Since then, I‚Äôve moved into robotics and edge AI, optimizing YOLO, RF-DETR, and transformer models for object detection, working with 3D point clouds for SLAM, and even quantizing large models so they can run efficiently on devices like Jetson Orin.<br>

I specialize in developing high-performance ML systems, blending model optimization, deployment, and edge computing to create solutions that are both scalable and practical. Whether it‚Äôs real-time robot path planning or automated automotive analysis, I enjoy solving problems where algorithms meet the physical world.<br>

I‚Äôm always looking for ways to push models closer to production‚Äîfaster, lighter, and smarter‚Äîall while keeping a sense of curiosity (and a steady supply of coffee ‚òï).<br>
